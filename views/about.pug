        p Blasteoroid Corporation, founded in 2017, is owned by two engineering students. Blasteoroid has aimed to provide many projects open to public for the technical implementation of them in higher organisation. Blasteoroid has also aimed for public learning or student learning through their main website. Blasteoroid provides content that can be used by researchers to improve technology and also provides new aspects of learning and implementation. Open Source means not open to public but to help public to learn, use and create something new of their own and to get their ideas to improve a company's products for public use worldwide.
